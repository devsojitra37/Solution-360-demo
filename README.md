> **Abstract**

Solution 360 is a name that plays a role in describing our application.
The admin at expert faculty master takes requests from faculty to
register, after which faculty can share their knowledge with students by
uploading tutorials or sharing videos on a specific topic. In this way,
solution 360 creates a bridge between students and professors. Professor
creates his profile and lists expertise for explorers. As a
self-student, he receives answers 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and
is able to expand his knowledge without regard to time constraints. We
discovered a slew of issues with present systems for producing or
executing results. We just want to build an expert network that is
relevant to the application.

goal of the application is to share knowledge with students and experts
in order to save time and provide precision to users.

**1.3** **SCOPE:**

➢This application is cutting-edge for small town colleges and
universities, as well as in terms of public demand on any technology via
Solution 360.

➢The second scope in the facture is to increase a visit of application
we reverse expert to offer a maximum knowledge and share to knowledge
are application and revert parameter is review is it post.

➢The third application scope is to develop a technology-based form or
social group to conduct research on creative projects that are relevant
to the application.

Technical Solution Website Page 3

**1.4** **OBJECTIVES:**

➢Observers suggest this application is unique for small institutions and
universities. ➢The student will receive an online remedy to his or her
problem.

➢This tool aims to build a social club based on technology for students,
as well as an expert spared by knowledge.

**1.5** **TECHNOLOGY** **AND** **LITRATURE** **REVIEWS:**

**ASP.NET**

➢ASP.NET is an open source server-side Web application framework that is
used to create dynamic Web pages.

➢Microsoft created it to help programmers create dynamic web sites, web
applications, and web services.

➢It is the successor to Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP)
technology, and was first introduced in January 2002 with version 1.0 of
the.NET Framework.

➢The Common Language Runtime (CLR) underpins ASP.NET, allowing
programmers to build ASP.NET code in any supported.NET language.

**Microsoft** **SQL** **Server**

➢Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system that
was created by the company Microsoft.

➢It is a database, which is a software product whose principal role is
to store and retrieve data as required by other software applications,
whether they are running on the same computer or on a networked computer
(including the Internet).

➢Microsoft SQL Server comes in a variety of editions aimed at different
audiences and workloads ranging from modest single-machine applications
to huge Internet-facing applications with many concurrent users.

➢T-SQL and ANSI SQL are the two most common query languages.

Technical Solution Website Page 4

**SQL** **server**

➢SQL Server includes a master data management solution known as Master
Data Services, which allows for the management of key data entities and
structures.

➢Multi Server Management is also available, which is a common console
for managing numerous SQL Server 2008 instances and services, such as
relational databases, Reporting Services, Analysis Services, and
Integration Services.

➢On July 11, 2011, the first SQL Server service pack (10.50.2500,
Service Pack 1) was released.

**2.** **Project** **Management**

> **Key** **Concepts:**

**2.1** **Software** **Process** **Model**

**2.2** **Milestones** **and** **Deliverables**

**2.1** **Software** **Process** **Model** **:**

**Waterfall** **Model**

> **Figure** **1.1** **Waterfall** **Model**

**Reason** **For** **Using** **Waterfall** **Model**

➢Processes based on the Waterfall Model are often used in the creation
of practical systems. The following phase in a traditional waterfall
model should not begin until the preceding phase has completed. In
reality, however, these steps overlap and feed data to one another.
During the design phase, issues with requirements are detected, and
during the coding phase,

> Technical Solution Website Page 6
>
> design issues are discovered, and so on. The developer is not a simple
> linear model, but rather a series of cycles.
>
> ➢Problems are pushed to the back burner, ignored, or coded around.
> This premature freezing of requirements may indicate that the system
> will not perform as requested by the user. It may also result in
> poorly structured systems as implementation methods are used to get
> around design problems.
>
> ➢Thus, in a system where you need to proceed from one phase to the
> next while receiving feedback from other phases, using a Waterfall
> Model with feedback is the best option.
>
> **Advantages** **of** **the** **Model:**
>
> ➢It is simple to explain to the user, with well-defined stages and
> tasks. ➢It is simple to verify at each level due to tracing.
>
> ➢Ensure that mistakes are detected as soon as possible. ➢Every phase
> requires testing.

**3.1** **Requirement** **engineering** **process:**

Requirement engineering is a procedure that includes all of the steps
involved in creating a system requirement document.

There are four activities in the high-level requirement engineering
process. These are the system

feasibility research, data extraction and analysis of requirements,
requirement specification and documentation, and, lastly, requirement
validation.

> **Figure** **2.1** **Requirement** **engineering** **process**

**3.2** **Feasibility** **study:**

Our application's feasibility analysis is in many stages, including
administration value, practicality, economic feasibility, and
implementation feasibility. Basically, we work on the application to
meet the client's primary criteria, as well as in our IDP application.
For cost efficiency and resource use, we closely adhere to the deadline.

> **3.2.1** **Operational** **Feasibility**
>
> Basically, because there isn't a single application for every
> profession, we create one for each user. The user interface is simple
> to use, and the navigation is smooth, especially when searching for
> documents for students. Our application instructs students from
> beginner to expert level knowledge and operation.
>
> Some e-commerce applications make it difficult for customers to
> explore categories and products, as well as order and dispatch
> processes.
>
> Some users or customers for the application are non-technical, thus we
> mostly design applications for high-tech people who use the internet
> on a daily basis, as well as those people who are comparatively
> non-technical.

> **3.2.2** **Technical** **Feasibility**
>
> To implement all of the capabilities for the application "Solution
> 360," significant technical competence is required.

>
> **3.2.3** **Scheduling** **Feasibility**
>
> We are using the IDP tool to schedule work that is new to us.
>
> After a testing phase, a case study and error scheduling take time,

> analysis, system design, coding, and testing. We establish deadlines
> for each phase and stick to them.
>
> We set the final deadline two weeks prior to the actual submission
> date or the client's submission date.
>
> **3.2.4** **Economical** **Feasibility**

**7.** **Limitations** **&** **Future** **Enhancement**

> **Key** **Concepts:**

**7.1** **Limitation**

**7.2** **Future** **Enhancement**

**7.1** **Limitation:-**

➢Our application was limited because we only applied for the technical
stream and did not consider the literacies or vocational courses.

➢Collection of experts is the most difficult aspect of this programme;
nonetheless, any expert conversational to regular update in application
is a critical portion in this application, and if this condition is not
met, the application will completely fail.

**7.2** **Future** **Enhancement:-**

➢High-level security

➢This application is trimming for small town colleges and universities,
as well as for public

> volume on any technology via Solution 360.

➢We reverse expert to give maximum knowledge and contribute to knowledge
are application and parameter of revert is review is it post.

➢The purpose of an application is to build a form or a social group
based on technology in order to conduct research on innovative projects
that are related to the application.

**8.** **Conclusion** **of** **Project**

**Conclusion** **:-**

We arrive to this conclusion by building this system. We will learn how
to design actual software, as well as how to assess and implement
systems. We also learn about system analysis and design, as well as how
to create web-based applications using ASP.NET.

Doing a project this semester was a fantastic learning experience for
us. This assignment has

provided us with invaluable experience. It's been like stepping on to a
step of a staircase going to our professional goals. It was our first
time working in a software company's environment.

We were fortunate to have very cooperative and helpful project leaders
and teammates during the

practical application of our expertise; their attitude toward us was
quite palliative, and they were always there in our needs.

While working on the same project, we also learned how to collaborate
with other staff. This

priceless experience will surely be helpful to us in the future.

For our public information, we create a single webpage. During the
building of the website, we

learned a variety of new skills, including how to create web
applications and gain new knowledge.

If we get the opportunity to construct another website in the future, we
will easily be able to do

so. The benefit of this service is that we can quickly obtain
information about unmarried users. We also use other types of database
connectivity with more features in this project.

We accomplished this project work in a short period of time, but it was
effective and efficient. During this project work, we also gained more
knowledge that will be used in the future when we create projects and in
fact.
